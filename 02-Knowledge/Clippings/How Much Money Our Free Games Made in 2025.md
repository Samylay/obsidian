This is how much money our mobile games and web/HTML5 games made in 2025 as a two-person indie game studio.  
  
Our total game development revenue this year: $42,179.96  
• Web / HTML5 games: $27,022.00  
• Mobile games (Android + iOS): $13,635.76  
• YouTube: $1,522.20  
  
We’ve been developing games with the Unity game engine since 2019, and for the first few years most of our income came from publisher funding.  
2025 was the first year we went fully independent, no publishers, no funding, and every dollar came directly from our games.  
The number may not be impressive but we hope it shows the realistic side of indie game development and inspires you on your own game dev journey.
