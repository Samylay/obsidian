the stack i will use 

obsidian
mycalendarapp



the vision for the calendar app should be to become sort of an all in one personnal assistant, it should drive me to journal, be my personnal coach, help me with trying new diets, help brainstorm new project ideas, assist my creativity...   


any data i feed the ai that will power the calendar app is to be stored in a way that makes it easy for when i need it to be fetched when i make my own llm and train it on said data

 Urge surfinf : Urge surfing is a mindfulness technique that helps individuals manage cravings by observing and accepting their urges without acting on them. It involves recognizing urges as temporary sensations that rise and fall, allowing a person to gain control and reduce impulsive behaviors.

customer first approach, what i need is to figure out what the productivity scene wants and if my AI calendar (alternative to Motionapp) would be interesting to them and if so how much they'd be willing to pay for it, i should likely post this in reddit to get the idea validated

## USER COMMENTS 
I also found reclaim a bit clunky. The concept made sense - but I was finding the meetings I had allowed it to change would wind up in a surprising location.

I wish it would have run hourly and just messaged me / slack or similar with some suggestions instead of just moving things around on its own

-------------------------------------
This is a really fair appraisal. I went from Motion to Reclaim and then back, but I'm slightly regretting it. Overall, I like Reclaim more as it has much better integrations with my ToDoist, it is less clunky and visually more interesting. However, Motion actually is persistent about rescheduling tasks that I haven't actually done. But they seem to have made it chunkier... I may move back, but I can't get over the automatic task rescheduled.

- Arc, as my default browser
    
- Dayone, for journaling
    
- Awesome Habits, for a more balanced life
    
- Todoist, for daily tasks
    
- Fantastical, for calendar
    
- Spark, for email

- Readwise and Reader, for read-it-later and highlighting

- A few small life improvements I can’t live without: Alfred, CleanMyMac, CleanShot X, Bartender, TextSniper, Dropzone, Timing, Paletro, and Leave Me Alone


Whoa, we're like 90% the same. I've got 14 different email accounts synced in Spark. Subscribed to 9 calendars in Fantastical that I use to duplicate to my iCloud calendar so my wife, 2 kids, and 4 grandparents can see the important events on their phones. 1Password family for all four of us. ChatGPT pro for ideation and Perplexity for spinning up landing pages. Asana/Notion to manage projects, probably moving solely to notion because their AI is getting great.

People who get interested in productivity are always looking for the best tools that will make the best.

The reality is that yes, tools can bring nice functionalities, but they are not what matter. Productivity is about doing the things you should (focus on a list of tasks, follow your system). Even with the most basic apps, if you follow your rules you are supposed to be more productive than 90% of people, so don’t focus too much on the tools, just choose a stack you like and stick to it.

For tasks, you can use Todoist. For calendar you can use Google Calendar or Notion calendar if you want something a bit more fancy. For notes you can stick with Apple Notes. For time tracking use Toggl. That’s it, stay with this stack, productivity is about having fun in doing the tasks and be good at what you do, not having fun trying new tools every other day.
