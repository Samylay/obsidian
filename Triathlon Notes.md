Avoid Bouncing
higher cadence (more steps/min)

### Training zones ( <70% / 70-90% / >90%)

### Training Intensity Distribution (TID)
How "Hard" a workout is

	Pyramidal Z1:80% Z2:15% Z3:5%
	80/20 Z1: 80% Z2:0-5% Z3:15-20%
	Threshold Z1:55-60% Z2:>35% Z3:0-5%

### Periodization:
Have training phases using different TIDs
#### Base Phase: Builds endurance -> Pyramidal
#### Build Phase: increases  intensity -> Threshold
#### Peak Phase: Specific training -> 80/20
#### Taper Phase: Volume decrease -> 80/20

#### Running economy 
- Strength training (Squats, deadlifts, power cleans, single leg exercices (bulgarian split squats))
- Plyometrics (Box jumps, standing tall jumps, bounding)
- Workouts: VO2 max intervals (fraco), rest 2 mins, short hill climbs, Tempo runs (3x10 minutes hard aka close to LT2), longruns, easy runs
- Drills: A skips, B skips, high knees
